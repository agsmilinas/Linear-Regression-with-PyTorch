Training and evaluating a linear regression model for the prediction of a student's grade considering hours studied and previous grade

Specs:

Graphing the data in 3D.
Carrying out the definition of the architecture using both the high and medium level interfaces.
Making a prediction with your trained model for the qualification that a student would have if we know that he studied for 12 hours for the exam and in a previous exam he obtained a qualification of 3.
